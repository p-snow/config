This is my config collection for my personal machine. These configs are applicable for Linux Mint Cinnamon edition and theoretically all distributions which is derived from Ubuntu.
Actual configs are sitting in [[file:dotfiles.org][dotfiles.org]] which adopts literate configuration. More readable version of this repo is available in [[https://p-snow.github.io/config][this website]].

* Requirements
- GNU/Emacs 27 or higher

* Usage
- extract dotfiles
  : make tangle
- export html files
  : make publish

* Configuration
By default 'make tangle' command extracts all dotfiles into '~/ghq/github.com/p-snow/dotfiles' which suits my needs.

Chnage following description in [[file:dotfiles.org][dotfiles.org]] if you'd like change this behavior
: #+PROPERTY: tangle-target-dir ~/ghq/github.com/p-snow/dotfiles
