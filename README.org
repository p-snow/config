#+title: @p-snow's home environment

This is my config collection for my personal machine. These configs are applicable for Linux Mint Cinnamon edition and theoretically all distributions which is derived from Ubuntu.
Actual configs are sitting in [[file:dotfiles.org][dotfiles.org]] which adopts literate configuration. More readable version of this repo is available in [[https://p-snow.github.io/config][this website]].

* Requirements
- GNU/Emacs 28.1 with native compilation support

* Usage
- extract dotfiles
  : make tangle
- export html files
  : make publish

* Configuration

'make tangle' generates dotfiles to
where tangle/root designate in tangle.el. The default value of tangle/root is "~/dotfiles/" which meets my needs. You can modify the variable's value as you like.

: (setq tangle/root "~/dotfiles/")
